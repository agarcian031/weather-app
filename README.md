## Objective: Build A Weather App With Vanilla Javascript  
---
### Overview: 

This is a project to focus more on building applications using vanilla javascript without frameworks. This project was intended as a way to study programming concepts that I had difficulty grasping while learning JS. This project incorperates DarkSky API to pull all the necessary weather information needed to build the project. It is important to note that DarkSky can be used for free for up to 1000 API calls.

### What Was Learned: 

* Display, position, and design of HTML and CSS 
* Handle real-time dates, locations, and weather
* Learn how to incorporate APIs and retrieve the needed information into the application.
